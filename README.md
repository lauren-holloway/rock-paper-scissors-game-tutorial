# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Tutorial
You may remember playing the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors as a kid. You and your bestfriend each held up a fist and shook them three times in the air. On the fourth fist shake you each exclaimed “Shoot!” as you quickly changed your hand position from a fist to one of the three hand positions designated for either rock, paper, or scissors. The rules:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.

In this beginner level tutorial, we will recreate this game as a console application in the C# programming language. 
Topics covered include:
- Variables & Types
- Input and Output
- Conditionals
- C# Naming, Layout, and Commenting Conventions

What you'll need to get started:
- [Visual Studio installed](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) (not to be confused with Visual Studio Code)

-OR-
- [REPLIT](https://replit.com/languages/csharp) (No installation/setup needed)

What you're building:
- [ ] C# console application
- [ ] Control options that show available player Moves (i.e. Rock, Paper, or Scissors)
- [ ] CPU Player randomly generates a move, also based on the control options
- [ ] Program compares the Player and CPU Player inputs and prints the game result to the console (i.e. You win)

## Let the Player Choose a Move
blah blah blah

## Randomly Generate a Move for the CPU Player

## BuildUp Challenges
- Add a `for loop` so the game will automatically play 3 times
