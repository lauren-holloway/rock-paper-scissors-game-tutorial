# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Tutorial
You may remember playing the hand game Rock, Paper, Scissors as a kid. You and your bestfriend each held up a fist and shook them three times in the air. On the fourth fist shake you each exclaimed “Shoot!” as you quickly changed your hand position from a fist to one of the three hand positions designated for either rock, paper, or scissors. The rules:

- Rock beats scissors.
- Scissors beats paper.
- Paper beats rock.
